A brutally honest password strength checker app built with Streamlit. It judges your password choices so you don’t have to! 🕵️‍♀️

---

## Features ✨

- **Password Analysis**:
  - Checks for minimum length (8+ characters)
  - Looks for numbers (because "password" isn’t cutting it)
  - Verifies uppercase letters (for that *fancy* touch)
  - Ensures special characters (because why not?)

- **Brutal Feedback**:
  - Provides *constructive* criticism for weak passwords
  - Rates your password on a scale of 0 to 4 (because perfection is overrated)

- **Security Score**:
  - Gives you a score out of 4 (and a pat on the back if you score above 2 🎉)

## How to Use 🚀

1. **Enter Your Password**:
   - Type your password into the input field (don’t worry, it’s hidden 🔒).

2. **Get Judged**:
   - The app will analyze your password and provide *honest* feedback.

3. **Improve Your Password**:
   - Follow the feedback to make your password stronger (or ignore it and live dangerously 🎲).
